// Create a class “Hostel” containing attributes hostelName, hostelLocation and noOfRooms. The class contains methods for getting and printing the attributes. 
// Then write “Student” class extending “Hostel” class and implementing “Department” interface. 
// This class contains attributes studentName, regNo, electiveSubject and avgMarks. 
// Write suitable getdata and printdata methods for this class. Also implement the abstract methods of the “Department” interface.
